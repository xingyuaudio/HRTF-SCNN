# HRTF-SCNN
Official implementation of the paper "Head-Related Transfer Function Interpolation with a Spherical CNN".
[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14013)]

##  Note
Our paper has been submitted to ICASSP 2024, and we intend to release the complete code after the results are announced on December 13th. Stay tuned for updates!

Here's a brief overview of the repository's structure:

- **dataset.py**: [Coming Soon] The `dataset.py` file will provide the necessary data preprocessing and loading functions. 

- **model.py**: This file contains the implementation of the learning model used in this project. It includes layers and the model architecture.

- **train.py**: [Coming Soon] The `train.py` file will contain the code for training the model using the HUTUBS dataset.
